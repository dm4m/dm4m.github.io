The DM4M(Data Mining for Miracles) Lab is located in Information Technology Center(208, 405, 411), led by Professor Chongyang Shi.  
Our research involves Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Intelligent Information Retrieval, Personalized Recommendation, Opinion and Sentiment Mining.  
Specifically, mainly focused on: 
1. Intelligent Information Retrieval and Knowledge Acquisition (finding the "truth" and "correlation" of facts)
2. Personalized Prediction and Recommendation (for example: predict the news you want to watch, recommend the clothes you want to buy, etc.)
3. Social Network Sentiment and Opinion Mining (for example: Douban evaluation, rumor and fake news detection, etc.)
4. Intelligent Generation (eg: news generation, story ending generation, paper review generation, etc.)
